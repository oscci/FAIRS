`r nrow(mypanel)` panelists signed up to take part in the survey, and completed surveys were received from `r nrow(df)` of them.  Those taking part were asked to self-identify into one of three groups, and the distribution of respondents was as follows: `r knitr::kable(table(df$group))`. 

```{r analysepanel,echo=F}
mypanel<-clean_names(mypanel)
gtab <- table(mypanel$gender)
ctab <- table(mypanel$which_continent_are_you_based_in)
rtab <- table(mypanel$reason_for_interest_in_taking_part)

emails<-mypanel$email_address
nUK <- length(grep(".uk",emails))
edoms <- str_split(emails,"@")
edoms <- unlist(edoms)
edoms <- edoms[seq(2,length(edoms),2)]

countrylist<-vector()
for (e in 1:length(edoms)){
g <- as.integer(regexpr("\\.[^\\.]*$", edoms[e])) #position of final 
ecountry <- substr(edoms[e],(g+1),nchar(edoms[e]))
countrylist<-c(countrylist,ecountry)
}
countrylist<-tolower(countrylist)

```
The gender distribution was as follows:  
`r knitr::kable(gtab)`    
The bulk of respondents were from Europe or N America:  
`r knitr::kable(ctab)`    

And the distribution of email domains was as follows:  
`r knitr::kable(table(countrylist))`  

For each item in the survey, we show the number of people selecting each response type, prorated to give equal group sizes. Free text comments are also shown.

### Item 7  
On balance, the role of social media in detecting and reporting serious research

## Models for addressing serious research misconduct 
### Item 9  
In an ideal world where resources are not an issue, which is the most suitable model/system for addressing serious research misconduct?

determining sanctions when one of their staff is accused   
- B. National governance approach, where government regulatory agency is set up for this purpose

regulatory role, but aims to ensure all institutions work to a common framework   
- D. Regulatory agency independent of Government

`r mytext <- df$x27_12b_o; gatherfree(mytext)`  

## Role of publishers  
### Item 13 
It is not the responsibility of publishers or journal editors to determine whether serious research misconduct has occurred, but they are responsible for ensuring the literature is decontaminated from erroneous work promptly. Please rate the following statements in accordance with your views on how this should work, from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. 

- A. Articles that contain serious errors that undermine confidence in the findings should be retracted promptly, without waiting for an institutional investigation  
- B. Publishers and institutions should work together to facilitate sharing of key information when serious research misconduct is suspected  
- C. If conditions for retraction are not met, an expression of concern may be added to an article while an institution conducts an investigation  
- D. When an institutional investigation is completed, the institution should directly approach the publisher of articles affected by severe research misconduct and request retraction  
- E. When a publisher finds the same author repeatedly flagged for erroneous material, they should communicate this to research integrity officer at the author's institution  
- F. When a publisher or institution finds the same researcher repeatedly flagged for erroneous material, their name should be added to a database. (NB. If there is sufficient endorsement of this statement, there would need to be discussion of how this works in terms of legal, practical and ethical aspects.)
